```ruby
### Testing task 2 code:

require_relative('card.rb')
class CardGame

 # weird capitialisation, use snake case
  def checkforAce(card)
    # needs == to compare equality
    if card.value = 1
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  # def misspelled.
  # missing comma between parameters
  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card.name
  # should be card1, no method for .name
  else
    card2   #missing return
  end
end
end

# end in wrong place, meant to close the class


def self.cards_total(cards)
  #total variable wrong
  total
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total  # missing string interpolation and a missing space

  end
end

# extra end should be placed here

```
